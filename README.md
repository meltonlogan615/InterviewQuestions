# InterviewQuestions
## Real World Swift Coding Challenges

If you want to get an idea of what kind of coding questions you might receive during an interview, you are in the right place. These are real coding challenges that I've received while applying for iOS roles (all company specific info has been scrubbed).


## If you would like to contribute:
- Create a New Playground Page
- Remove any information that would identify the source organization
- Provide the challenge as you had originally received it, excluding the above mentioned.
- Submit a PR
